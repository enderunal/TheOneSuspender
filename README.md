## Why The One Suspender?

I developed this extension because The Marvelous Suspender (TMS) could not support Manifest V3, and I couldn't find an alternative that met my specific needs. I found that rewriting TMS from scratch was a more viable path than attempting to port it. The One Suspender includes all the features you're familiar with from The Great Suspender and TMS, plus additional enhancements.

Auto-suspend inactive tabs with full manual controls, robust scheduling, advanced security for Chrome (Manifest V3), and a beautiful dark mode.

## Features

- **Automatic Tab Suspension**: Frees memory by suspending inactive tabs after a user-defined timeout (Minimum 1 min).
- **Manual Controls**: Suspend/unsuspend individual tabs or all tabs in a window/all windows from the popup.
- **Export/Import Suspended Tabs**: Export all suspended tabs (with window/tab structure) as JSON or TXT, and import them laterâ€”even across extension reinstalls or devices. (See below for details.)
- **Two Suspension Modes**: 
  - **Preserve History (default):** Uses regular suspension, keeping tab history and state.
  - **Close & Reopen:** Experimental! Might free more RAM when preserve history does not help but loses tab history. Might consume more CPU.
- **Whitelist Management**: Never suspend specific URLs/domains (with wildcard support).
- **Conditional Exceptions**: Never suspend pinned tabs, tabs playing audio, active tabs, tabs with unsaved form data, etc.
- **Ask Before Suspending**: Prompts user if unsaved form data is detected (see below).
- **Visual Indicators**: Grayed-out favicon for suspended tabs, with robust CORS/SVG handling.
- **Customizable Settings**: All options available in a modern, responsive Options page with theme selection.
- **ðŸŒ™ Dark Mode**: Beautiful Material UI-inspired dark theme that applies across all extension pages (options, popup, suspended pages). Toggle between light and dark themes in settings.
- **Security-First**: Strict CSP, minimal permissions, secure messaging, and no user-supplied DOM injection.

## Export/Import Suspended Tabs

**Easily backup or migrate your suspended tabs!**

- **Export:**
  - Go to the Options page.
  - Use the Export section to download all currently suspended tabs (with window/tab structure) as a `.json` or `.txt` file.
  - The export includes all suspended tabs, grouped by window, with titles, favicons, and original URLs.

- **Import:**
  - Use the Import section in the Options page to select a previously exported file.
  - The extension will recreate the original window/tab structure and immediately suspend the imported tabs.
  - **Extension ID Handling:** If you import on a different device or after reinstalling, the extension will automatically update the internal suspended tab URLs to match the new extension IDâ€”no manual editing required.
  - Comprehensive error handling and validation is included.

---

## Architecture & Scheduling Flow

- **Centralized Scheduling**: All tabs are tracked in a single `tabSuspendTimes` map (see [tab-scheduling-flow.md](docs/tab-scheduling-flow.md)).
- **Single Scan Alarm**: A single Chrome alarm periodically checks all tabs for suspension eligibility.
- **Tab Classification**: Tabs are classified with robust rules (see [tab-classifier.js](src/common/tab-classifier.js)).
- **Debounced Rescheduling**: Prevents alarm thrashing on rapid changes.
- **Error Handling**: All tab/window queries are robust to missing/closed entities.

See the following diagrams for a visual overview:
- [Alarm Flow Diagram](docs/alarm-flow.puml)
- [Event Flow Diagram](docs/event-flow.puml)
- [Extension Alarms & Messaging](docs/extension-alarms-messaging.puml)

## Ask-Before-Suspend Flow

When "Ask Before Suspending" is enabled for unsaved form data:
1. Scheduler detects a tab is due for suspension and checks for unsaved form data.
2. If unsaved data is found, the background sends a `PROMPT_SUSPEND` message to the content script.
3. The content script displays a modal dialog asking the user to confirm suspension.
4. If the user confirms, the content script sends a `MSG_SUSPEND_TAB` message back to the background, which then suspends the tab manually.
5. If the user cancels, the tab is left active and not suspended.

See [tab-scheduling-flow.md](docs/tab-scheduling-flow.md) and the diagrams above for details.
