## Why The One Suspender?

I developed this extension because The Marvelous Suspender (TMS) could not support Manifest V3, and I couldn't find an alternative that met my specific needs. Rewriting TMS from scratch was a more viable path than attempting to port it. The One Suspender includes all the features you're familiar with from The Great Suspender and TMS, plus additional improvements.

Auto-suspend inactive tabs with full manual controls, robust scheduling, modern security for Chrome (Manifest V3), and a clean Material Design interface with multiple color themes.

## Easy Migration From The Marvelous Suspender

![Migration Interface](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3076f48a-59f0-4fda-8ccc-06b7100e99fa)

The One Suspender includes a **one-click migration tool** that automatically detects and converts all your existing Marvelous Suspender tabs to The One Suspender format. Simply visit the migration page from the Options menu and click "Migrate All Tabs" to seamlessly transition your suspended tabs.

## Features

### **Automatic Tab Suspension**
- **Smart Scheduling**: Frees memory by suspending inactive tabs after a user-defined timeout
- **Conditional Exceptions**: Never suspend pinned tabs, tabs playing audio, active tabs, tabs with unsaved form data, or when browser is offline
- **Dynamic Rescheduling**: Automatically reschedules suspension when tab status changes

### **Two Suspension Modes**
- **Preserve History (Default)**: Uses Chrome's tab discarding API to maintain back/forward navigation history
- **Close & Reopen (Experimental)**: Completely closes and reopens tabs to potentially free more memory but loses tab history

### **Manual Controls**
- **Individual Tab Control**: Suspend/unsuspend specific tabs via popup or keyboard shortcuts
- **Bulk Operations**: Suspend/unsuspend all tabs in current window or all windows
- **Multi-Tab Selection**: Select multiple tabs in popup for batch operations
- **Quick Actions**: Never suspend URL/domain toggles in popup

### **Export/Import Suspended Tabs**
**Easily backup, migrate, or share your suspended tabs across devices!**

- **Export Options**: 
  - Download all currently suspended tabs as JSON or TXT format
  - Preserves complete window/tab structure with titles, favicons, and original URLs
  - Includes tab positioning and pinned status
- **Import Capabilities**:

  - Automatic extension ID handling for cross-device compatibility

### **Whitelist Management**
