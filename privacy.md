# Privacy Policy for The One Suspender

**THIS EXTENSION COLLECTS ABSOLUTELY NO USER DATA. IT NEVER HAS, AND IT NEVER WILL!**

The One Suspender is built with your privacy as its highest priority. We believe you have the right to a private browsing experience, and this extension is designed to uphold that right.

## Data Collection and Usage: ZERO

*   **No Personal Information:** We do not collect, store, transmit, or have access to any of your personal information, browsing history, or any other data related to your online activity.
*   **Local Operation:** All functionalities of The One Suspender operate entirely on your local computer, within your browser.
*   **Local Storage Only:** Any settings you configure for this extension (like suspension times or whitelisted sites) are stored *only* on your computer using your browser's local storage. This data is for your use only and is never sent to us or any third party.

## Why This Matters

Many extensions collect data for various reasons. We want to be explicitly clear: The One Suspender is **not** one of them. Your browsing habits are your own.

## Permissions

The extension requests a minimal set of permissions necessary for its core functionality (like managing tabs and storing your settings locally). These permissions are **solely** for the features described and are **not** used to access or collect any of your data. You can review the specific permissions requested in the `manifest.json` file in our source code and during installation.
