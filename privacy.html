                The One Suspender is built with your privacy as its highest priority. We believe you have the right to a
                private browsing experience, and this extension is designed to uphold that right.

                    <strong>No Personal Information:</strong> We do not collect, store, transmit, or have access to any

                    <strong>Local Storage Only:</strong> Any settings you configure for this extension (like suspension

            <h2 class="md-typescale-title-large section-title">Why This Matters</h2>
            <p class="md-typescale-body-medium">
                Many extensions collect data for various reasons. We want to be explicitly clear: The One Suspender is
                <strong>not</strong> one of them. Your browsing habits are your own.
            </p>

            <h2 class="md-typescale-title-large section-title">Permissions</h2>
            <p class="md-typescale-body-medium">
                The extension requests a minimal set of permissions necessary for its core functionality (like managing
                tabs
                and storing your settings locally). These permissions are <strong>solely</strong> for the features
                described and
                are <strong>not</strong> used to access or collect any of your data. You can review the specific
                permissions
                requested in the <code class="inline-code">manifest.json</code> file in our source code and during
                installation.
