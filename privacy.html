    <h1>Privacy Policy for The One Suspender</h1>

    <strong class="no-data">THIS EXTENSION COLLECTS ABSOLUTELY NO USER DATA. IT NEVER HAS, AND IT NEVER WILL!</strong>

    <p>The One Suspender is built with your privacy as its highest priority. We believe you have the right to a private
        browsing experience, and this extension is designed to uphold that right.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection and Usage: ZERO</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Personal Information:</strong> We do not collect, store, transmit, or have access to any of your
            personal information, browsing history, or any other data related to your online activity.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Operation:</strong> All functionalities of The One Suspender operate entirely on your local
            computer, within your browser.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Storage Only:</strong> Any settings you configure for this extension (like suspension times or
            whitelisted sites) are stored <em>only</em> on your computer using your browser's local storage. This data
            is for your use only and is never sent to us or any third party.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>Many extensions collect data for various reasons. We want to be explicitly clear: The One Suspender is
        <strong>not</strong> one of them. Your browsing habits are your own.
    </p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>The extension requests a minimal set of permissions necessary for its core functionality (like managing tabs and
        storing your settings locally). These permissions are <strong>solely</strong> for the features described and are
        <strong>not</strong> used to access or collect any of your data. You can review the specific permissions
        requested in the <code>manifest.json</code> file in our source code and during installation.
    </p>

    <h2>Questions?</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about our privacy practices, please feel free to open an issue on our <a
            href="[Link to your GitHub issues page]" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub issues page</a>.</p>
