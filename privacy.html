        <h2>Privacy Policy for The One Suspender</h2>

        <strong class="no-data">THIS EXTENSION COLLECTS ABSOLUTELY NO USER DATA. IT NEVER HAS, AND IT NEVER
            WILL!</strong>

        <p>The One Suspender is built with your privacy as its highest priority. We believe you have the right to a
            private
            browsing experience, and this extension is designed to uphold that right.</p>

        <h3>Data Collection and Usage: ZERO</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Personal Information:</strong> We do not collect, store, transmit, or have access to any of
                your
                personal information, browsing history, or any other data related to your online activity.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Operation:</strong> All functionalities of The One Suspender operate entirely on your
                local
                computer, within your browser.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Storage Only:</strong> Any settings you configure for this extension (like suspension
                times or
                whitelisted sites) are stored <em>only</em> on your computer using your browser's local storage. This
                data
                is for your use only and is never sent to us or any third party.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
        <p>Many extensions collect data for various reasons. We want to be explicitly clear: The One Suspender is
            <strong>not</strong> one of them. Your browsing habits are your own.
        </p>

        <h3>Permissions</h3>
        <p>The extension requests a minimal set of permissions necessary for its core functionality (like managing tabs
            and
            storing your settings locally). These permissions are <strong>solely</strong> for the features described and
            are
            <strong>not</strong> used to access or collect any of your data. You can review the specific permissions
            requested in the <code>manifest.json</code> file in our source code and during installation.
        </p>
